# 🎯 WHAT YOU NEED TO DO NOW

## Immediate Action (5 minutes)

### 1. **Set Up MongoDB** (if you haven't already)
```
1. Go to: https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas
2. Create a FREE account
3. Create a cluster
4. Get MongoDB URI (looks like: mongodb+srv://user:pass@cluster.mongodb.net/)
```

### 2. **Update Backend .env File**
```bash
cd backend
# Edit the .env file and replace these values:

PORT=8001
MONGODB_URI=YOUR_MONGODB_URI_HERE  ← Replace with your URI
MONGO_USER=YOUR_USERNAME_HERE       ← Replace with your username
NODE_ENV=development
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. **Run Locally to Test**
```bash
# Terminal 1:
cd backend
npm run dev

# Terminal 2 (new terminal):
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Open: http://localhost:8000
```

✓ **Test all features**: login, video call, screen share, chat

## ⚡ 3-Step Quick Start

```bash
# Step 1: Edit backend/.env with MongoDB URI
# (Open backend/.env in any text editor, paste your MongoDB URI)

# Step 2: Backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# Step 3: Frontend (NEW TERMINAL)
cd frontend

## 🌍 Share on Network

Once running, other devices on same WiFi can access:
```
http://YOUR_COMPUTER_IP:8000
```

Find IP:
- Windows: `ipconfig` → Look for "IPv4 Address"
- Mac: `ifconfig` → Look for "inet"
- Linux: `ip addr` → Look for "inet"

Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000`
